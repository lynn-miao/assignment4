For NYU Spatial Analysis Class
Spring 2024

For this assignment, I pulled a a shapefile of all the NYC subway lines, and plotted them on a map. If you click on a line, the line will highlight and the box will tell you which line you clicked on, and highlight all the interconnected lines. 

You can also click on a button, and the lines will highlight.

Ideally, I would have loaded more information or fun facts about each line, but I couldn't figure out a way to embed that information in a systematic way - would that have to have come in as part of the geojson file? 

The shapefile is also oddly broken up, with a distinct shape for each line combination - for example, there is not a single line for the A, but rather a line for the A, then a line for the A/C, then a line for the A/C/E, and then a line for the A/C again.
